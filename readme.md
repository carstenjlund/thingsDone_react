# About this application

This is a small 'things done' application written in react

It is a demonstration of a react application, that is based on functional style components and hooks.

The application is inspired by an online tutorial about web components. I forget which one it is, but when I remember I will post a link here. I decided to redo it in React to see the differences.

I later extended the project a little bit, adding the React Router wiht sub-pages, and fetching of data, and populating components with the useEffects-hook.

The repo is deployed to netlify at [this link](https://nestrac-react-app.netlify.app)

<sub><sup>This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).</sup></sub>
